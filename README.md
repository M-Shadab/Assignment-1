These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

I have used nodejs csv parser ```csvtojson module``` to parse csv to json or column arrays.

### Prerequisites

```
Change directory to project directory
```
$ cd Assignment-1
```
Use npm install to download all the required dependencies into current directory .
```
$ npm install
```
run the project using command
#### Command run For problem -1

### Notes

Make sure field-name in the Data.csv file does not contain any blank space.
